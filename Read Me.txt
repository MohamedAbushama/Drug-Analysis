> 3. Y drug is the most dominant drug in the dataset followed by X drug 
> 4.  Male proportion slightly higher than female in the dataset 
> 5. With normal BP the most used drugs are X & Y respectively, with high BP Drug B is involved, and with Low BP Drug C is involved
> 6. We can see that Drug C is used for the high Cholesterol patients besides all the other Drugs with different percentages 
> 7. We can confirm from this plot that Males using Drug A more than Females, with slightly different usage for the rest of drugs 
> 8. Normal BP has the lowest average of NA to K, and high BP has the highest average 
> 9. Drug Y is used for patients whose Na to K ratio is higher than 20, other drugs used for patients whose Na to K ratio below 15
